- This app was made to learn more about ReactJS and to think in a 'Reactive way'
- It was also made to practice styling with styled-components, which is a great library for organization

## Timer

  - Here you can set the hours / minutes / seconds
  - Then there is the start and reset buttons, where the start toggles between start/stop

## Stopwatch

  - Here you have all the basic functions of a stopwatch, which is having a button to start, stop, reset and register a lap
  - The start button toggles between start/stop, while the reset button toggles between reset/lap, where the second case only happens when the stopwatch is running
